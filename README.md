# Coding Challenges

This repo will contain the references to other repos that contain the solutions on each language.

The main idea is to solve each challenge on several languages, as a practice and as a way to test the "performance"
of each language solving especific problems.

Other reason to separate the projects is becase I want to use Travis CI and It doesn't support a clear separation
when building from repos that contain more than one language.
